## **Step-by-Step Guide: Building and Testing Your First Web Application**

This guide will walk you through developing the **FastAPI Calculator** web application, implementing tests, and setting up continuous integration using GitHub Actions. By the end of this guide, you will have hands-on experience with web development and testing practices.

---

### **Step 1: Understanding Web Applications and REST APIs**

#### **1.1 What is a Web Application?**

A web application is a software program that runs on a web server and can be accessed through a web browser over the internet. It typically consists of:

- **Frontend:** The user interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that runs in the user's browser.
- **Backend:** The server-side application that processes requests, performs computations, and interacts with databases.

#### **1.2 What are REST APIs?**

REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs are a set of principles that define how web services communicate over HTTP. They allow clients (like web browsers or other applications) to interact with the server by sending requests and receiving responses, typically in JSON format.

**Key Concepts:**

- **HTTP Methods:** Standard methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE used to perform actions.
- **Endpoints:** URLs that represent resources or actions.
- **Statelessness:** Each request from a client contains all the information needed to process it.

#### **1.3 Introduction to FastAPI**

**FastAPI** is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

**Features:**

- **High Performance:** On par with NodeJS and Go.
- **Easy to Use:** Designed to be easy to use and learn.
- **Automatic Documentation:** Provides interactive API documentation.

---

### **Step 2: Exploring the FastAPI Calculator Application**

#### **2.1 Application Structure**

- **`app/operations.py`:** Contains arithmetic functions (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`).
- **`main.py`:** Defines the FastAPI application, including API endpoints and serving the HTML page.
- **`templates/index.html`:** The HTML frontend that interacts with the API.
- **`static/scripts.js`:** JavaScript file that handles user interactions and API calls.

#### **2.2 Understanding HTML and JavaScript in the Application**

- **HTML (`index.html`):** Structures the web page with input fields and buttons for calculator operations.
- **JavaScript (`scripts.js`):** Handles events like button clicks, retrieves input values, sends requests to the API, and updates the page with results.

**Key Points:**

- The frontend sends data to the backend API using JavaScript's `fetch` method.
- Responses from the API are processed and displayed to the user.

---

### **Step 3: Setting Up the Development Environment**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fastapi-calculator.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd fastapi-calculator
   ```
3. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
6. **Access the Application:**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

---

### **Step 4: Writing and Organizing Tests**

#### **4.1 Unit Tests with Pytest**

- **Purpose:** Test individual functions in `operations.py` to ensure they work correctly.
- **Location:** `tests/unit/test_operations.py`
- **Example:**

  ```python
  import pytest
  from app.operations import add, subtract, multiply, divide

  def test_add():
      assert add(2, 3) == 5

  def test_divide_by_zero():
      with pytest.raises(ValueError):
          divide(10, 0)
  ```

#### **4.2 Integration Tests with Pytest**

- **Purpose:** Test the API endpoints to ensure they integrate properly with the backend logic.
- **Location:** `tests/integration/test_api.py`
- **Example:**

  ```python
  from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
  from main import app

  client = TestClient(app)

  def test_add_endpoint():
      response = client.post("/add", json={"a": 2, "b": 3})
      assert response.status_code == 200
      assert response.json() == {"result": 5}
  ```

#### **4.3 End-to-End Tests with Playwright**

- **Purpose:** Simulate user interactions with the web application and test the application flow.
- **Location:** `tests/e2e/test_e2e.py`
- **Setup:**

  - Install Playwright and set up browsers:
    ```bash
    pip install playwright
    playwright install
    ```

- **Example:**

  ```python
  import pytest
  from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

  def test_calculator_addition():
      with sync_playwright() as p:
          browser = p.chromium.launch()
          page = browser.new_page()
          page.goto("http://localhost:8000")
          page.fill("#a", "2")
          page.fill("#b", "3")
          page.click("button#add")
          result = page.inner_text("#result")
          assert result == "Result: 5"
          browser.close()
  ```

---

### **Step 5: Implementing Logging**

1. **Configure Logging in `main.py`:**

   ```python
   import logging

   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
   ```

2. **Add Logging Statements:**

   ```python
   @app.post("/add")
   async def add_numbers(numbers: Numbers):
       logger.info(f"Adding {numbers.a} and {numbers.b}")
       result = add(numbers.a, numbers.b)
       return {"result": result}
   ```

3. **Verify Logs:**
   - Run the application and observe logs in the console to ensure they provide useful information.

---

### **Step 6: Utilizing Git for Version Control**

1. **Initialize Git Repository:**

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **Create a `.gitignore` File:**
   - Include common patterns to exclude, such as virtual environment directories and compiled files.

3. **Commit Changes Regularly:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit with application code and tests"
   ```

4. **Push to GitHub:**

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/fastapi-calculator.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

### **Step 7: Setting Up Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions**

1. **Create Workflow File:**

   - Path: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

2. **Workflow Configuration:**

   ```yaml
   name: CI

   on: [push, pull_request]

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v2

       - name: Set up Python
         uses: actions/setup-python@v2
         with:
           python-version: '3.9'

       - name: Install dependencies
         run: |
           pip install -r requirements.txt
           pip install pytest playwright
           playwright install

       - name: Run Unit Tests
         run: pytest tests/unit/

       - name: Run Integration Tests
         run: pytest tests/integration/

       - name: Run End-to-End Tests
         run: pytest tests/e2e/
   ```

3. **Commit and Push Workflow File:**

   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
   git commit -m "Add CI workflow for automated testing"
   git push
   ```

4. **Verify Workflow Execution:**
   - Check the **Actions** tab on your GitHub repository to see the workflow run.
